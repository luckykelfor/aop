This is a light-weight AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming) framework.
It supports multiple aspects' static weaving.
Template meta programming techniques are used.

USAGE:

1. First declare your own aspect, and it must be derived from aop::BaseAspect.
You should implement your own Before() and After() advices.

2. See usages in main(). It should be simple.
